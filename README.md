# Introduction
This project analyzes Data Analyst job postings to uncover insights about the job market. Using SQL queries, it explores:

üîé Top-paying roles (highest salaries for Data Analysts, including remote jobs)

üè¢ Company demand (which companies are hiring the most)

üõ† In-demand skills (skills most frequently required for Data Analyst roles in India)

üí∞ Optimal skills to learn (skills that offer the best balance of high demand and high salary)

The goal is to help aspiring and current Data Analysts identify the most valuable skills to focus on for better career opportunities.
# Background
The demand for Data Analysts is rapidly increasing in India as companies continue to make data-driven decisions. However, job seekers often struggle to identify which skills are most valued in the market and which roles offer the highest salaries.

1. What are the top paying jobs for my role?

2. What are the skills required for these top paying roles?

3. What are the most in-demand skills for data analyst?.

4. What are the top skills based on salary for my role?

5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
